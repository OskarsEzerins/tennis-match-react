### **What is TennisMatch?** 

TennisMatch is an interactive scheduling application that allows users to schedule tennis matches with other users. It allows app users to share their availability and find other players to play tennis with. The app lets you find others to play with, and allows others to schedule games with you based on your availability in an easy-to-use interface. The messenger allows you to communicate directly with other players.  

**Motivation behind developing TennisMatch**

We wanted an easy way to schedule tennis matches with other people in our area.

### **How do I use TennisMatch?**

* First, create an account or log in. If you do not wish to create an account, feel free to log in with the dummy account: 
```
username: TennisUser 
password: TennisPassword
```
* On the home page is the feed which shows you recently confirmed events by yourself and other users.
* On the Profile page, you may include more information about yourself including your location.
* If you want to share you availability (that others will be able to see) you can either click on the (+) or the (calendar) tab. 
* If you want to search for others' availability, you can go to Propose Match, and search for the date you wish to play on. It will list all the players who are seeking someone to play with. Here, you may then propose a specific time to play with a player within their availability.
* You can also search for a specific player with which to play against by clicking 'Propose Match to Player'. 
* Watch for notifications in the [tennis racket icon] drawer. If somebody has sent you a request to play, there will be a notification dot. Requests from other players to play with you will appear in Requests. You may then confirm or deny these requests.
* All of your availability, proposed matches and confirmed events will appear on the [scheduler (calendar icon here)] page.
* You may also communicate with other players directly by going to Messenger (messenger icon here).
